# Serverless URL Shortner

This project helps us to store long urls in a shorter format. Whenever we input the url in its shorter key word, it directly opens up the website.

For example:
    https://www.amazon.com/  can be stored as `'Amazon Website'` in its shorter form. So when we input 'Amazon Website' to the API, it should direct us 'https://www.amazon.com/'.
